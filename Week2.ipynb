    "Opening a restaurant is the easiest way to make money. On the contrary, it is way more complicated. So how complicated? There are many factors one has to consider before opening a restaurant. One deciding factor is location. Why location? A luxury restaurant in a poor village, a beef-specialized restaurant in Hindus community are all examples of poor choice of location. How to choose a good location? Worst news is that there is no correct answer like in maths. We have to use try-and-error method to figure out which works well and which doesn't. Changing restaurant's location several time really hurts one's pocket. It is a costly process. A process which can be greatly reduced in cost if we utilize Data Science.\n",
